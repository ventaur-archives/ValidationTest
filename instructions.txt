  configure FubuMVC application settings

The FubuMVC application is defined in the ValidationTestApplication class.  It's unlikely that you'll
need to customize the application bootstrapping, but ValidationTestApplication is where that would
happen.  You will want to refer to this class later if you use multiple forms of hosting (ASP.Net, 
Katana, or Serenity).

* HomeEndpoint.Index() could be eliminated if you choose
  to use Home.Spark as an 'actionless view'
* Shared/Application.spark is the master layout for the application
* Do check out the available Spark bindings in Shared/bindings.xml
